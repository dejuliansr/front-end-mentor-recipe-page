### What I learned

By working on this challenge, I was able to learn various important concepts in front-end web development. I will understand how to create a semantic HTML structure, use Flexbox for responsive layout, and manage images and text well, and also learn how to use tables and create text in list form, this challenge teaches CSS applications such as the use of color, spacing between elements, and visual effects such as shadows and corner radii to create interesting looks. Overall, it helped improve my understanding of responsive design and best practices in front-end development.
